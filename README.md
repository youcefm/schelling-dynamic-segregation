# schelling-dynamic-segregation
Visual rendering of Schelling's dynamic segregation game and variants of it

This project is inspired by Thomas Schelling's 1969 paper ["Dynamic Models of Segregation"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf)

The current version of the projects allows to visualize the dynamics of the "line" model and modify the parameters:

I hope to make the line model code more general to make modifications and generalizations easier, and in parallel, add the grid model as well as a circle model.
