# schelling-dynamic-segregation
Visual rendering of Schelling's dynamic segregation game and variants of it.

This project is inspired by Thomas Schelling's 1971 paper ["Dynamic Models of Segregation"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf)

The current version of the project allows to visualize the dynamics of the "line" model and modify the parameters:

- [x] 
~The next step is to make the line model code more general, providing a solid framework for modifications and extensions. Other plans include adding the grid model as well as a circle model.~  
## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pygame package
