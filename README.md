# schelling-dynamic-segregation
Visual rendering of Schelling's dynamic segregation game and variants of it.

This project is inspired by Thomas Schelling's 1971 paper ["Dynamic Models of Segregation"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf)

# Purpose
The goal of this project is to build a quality code base that allows to easily try variations of every aspect of the model. Some of the ideas can also be used to develop a general purpose Agent Based Modeling toolkit.

Demo of a mdeofication to line model from Schelling's paper to be on a circle:
